# BREAK OUT GAME

Text about the project. This would also be a great place to link the game on Netlify.

# Installation

Here is the link http://eggie.love/fun-game/

# Code Review

1. The project looks great in desktop but in mobile view the  text ‘Score’ disappears .
2. `game.js` - For readability it would be great to have comments describing the different functions.
3. Your game works in mobile but perhaps it would be easier to navigate the ‘plate’ with touch-move or something similar.
4. Short and concise style.css but it is missing css-variables for colors.
5. `game.js:139&146` - Great work using your font in Javascript but I can not see any woff or voff2 format , is this on purpose? If so, why?
 
 Overall great work and I really like you useless web!
